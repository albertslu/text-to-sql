```
You: "Analyze the population distribution across continents"
SQL Agent: [Generates GROUP BY continent query]
Analyst Agent: [Performs statistical analysis on results]
Result: Detailed breakdown with mean, std dev, outliers
```

**Follow-up**:
```
You: "Find any outliers in city populations"
Analyst Agent: [Uses IQR method to identify outliers]
Result: Cities like Shanghai, Buenos Aires flagged as outliers
```

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent orchestration
- ‚úÖ Advanced statistical analysis
- ‚úÖ Outlier detection algorithms

### **Act 3: External Data Integration** (2 minutes)
**Showcase**: Data enrichment with external APIs

```
You: "Tell me about Paris and enrich it with weather data"
Agent: [Queries Paris data, then enriches with weather API]
Result: Population: 2.1M, Weather: 18¬∞C, Sunny, 65% humidity
```

**Follow-up**:
```
You: "Get economic data for the top 3 European cities"
Agent: [Identifies Rome, Paris, London, enriches with economic data]
Result: GDP per capita, unemployment rates, cost of living indices
```

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ External API integration
- ‚úÖ Data enrichment capabilities
- ‚úÖ Multi-step reasoning

### **Act 4: Query Optimization** (2 minutes)
**Showcase**: Intelligent query planning and optimization

```
You: "I want to find patterns in city data"
Query Planner: [Analyzes request, suggests multiple approaches]
Options:
1. Population vs Popularity correlation
2. Geographic clustering analysis  
3. Regional development patterns
```

**Follow-up**:
```
You: "Optimize this query for better insights"
Planner: [Suggests adding statistical functions, grouping, filtering]
Result: Enhanced query with AVG, STDDEV, percentile calculations
```

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ Query optimization intelligence
- ‚úÖ Multiple solution approaches
- ‚úÖ Performance considerations

### **Act 5: Complex Orchestration** (3 minutes)
**Showcase**: Full workflow automation

```
You: "Give me a comprehensive analysis of European vs Asian cities"
Workflow:
1. SQL Agent: Generates comparative queries
2. Analyst Agent: Statistical analysis of both regions
3. Enrichment: Weather/economic data for top cities
4. Insights: Comprehensive report with recommendations
```

**Result**: Multi-page analysis with:
- Population statistics by region
- Economic indicators comparison
- Geographic distribution patterns
- Outlier identification
- Correlation analysis
- Actionable insights

**Key Points**:
- ‚úÖ End-to-end workflow automation
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent collaboration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive analysis
- ‚úÖ Production-ready architecture

## üé™ Impressive Demo Moments

### **"Wow" Moment 1: Memory Callback**
```
[After 10 queries]
You: "Remember that European analysis we did earlier?"
Agent: "Yes, we analyzed European cities and found an average population of 361,379. Would you like me to compare that with other regions?"
```

### **"Wow" Moment 2: Intelligent Suggestions**
```
Agent: "I notice you're interested in population patterns. Based on your queries, you might want to explore:
1. Population density vs geographic coordinates
2. Correlation between city popularity and economic indicators
3. Seasonal population variations (if we had time-series data)"
```

### **"Wow" Moment 3: Multi-Agent Coordination**
```
SQL Agent: "I'll generate the population query"
Analyst Agent: "I'll analyze the statistical distribution"
Enrichment Tool: "I'll add economic context"
Result: Seamless collaboration producing rich insights
```
