# 🚀 Advanced Text-to-SQL Agent - Take Home Submission

**Candidate**: Albert Lu  
**Assignment**: Text-to-SQL Agent with Mastra  
**Completion Date**: August 30, 2025

## 🎯 What I Built

I transformed the basic "text-to-SQL" requirement into a sophisticated AI agent that demonstrates production-ready capabilities and advanced AI engineering patterns.

### **System Architecture**
- **Single Intelligent Agent** with 4 specialized tools
- **Persistent Memory System** using LibSQL storage (remembers 15 recent messages)
- **SQLite Database** with 1,047 world cities and rich geographic data
- **Production-Ready Design** with error handling, validation, and security measures

### **Four Specialized Tools Implemented**

1. **`execute_sql`** - Safe SQL generation and execution
   - Validates SELECT-only queries (prevents SQL injection)
   - Connects to SQLite database with 1,047 cities
   - Handles complex queries: aggregations, geographic analysis, statistical operations

2. **`enrich_city_data`** - External data integration
   - Simulates API calls for weather, economic, demographic data
   - Demonstrates extensible architecture for real-world API integration
   - Shows production considerations for external service handling

3. **`explain_query`** - Educational SQL explanations
   - Parses SQL queries and explains them in plain English
   - Provides learning tips at different complexity levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
   - Demonstrates transparency and educational value in AI systems

4. **`generate_insights`** - Contextual intelligence
   - Provides smart suggestions based on query results
   - Generates follow-up questions and analysis recommendations
   - Shows advanced reasoning about data patterns and user intent

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Start the system**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open browser** → `http://localhost:4119` (or whatever port is shown)

## 🎭 Demo Flow

Try this sequence to see all four tools in action:

1. **"Show me the 5 most populous cities"** 
   → Uses `execute_sql` tool for basic query generation and execution

2. **"What was the average population of those cities?"** 
   → Demonstrates memory system - agent remembers previous results

3. **"Explain that query to me"** 
   → Uses `explain_query` tool to break down the SQL in plain English

4. **"Find cities in the Southern Hemisphere"** 
   → Shows geographic intelligence using latitude coordinates

5. **"Get weather data for Paris"** 
   → Uses `enrich_city_data` tool for external data integration

6. **"What insights can you give me about global city patterns?"** 
   → Uses `generate_insights` tool for contextual analysis and suggestions

## 🏆 Key Technical Achievements

### **AI Agent Architecture**
- **Tool-Based Design**: 4 specialized tools working in coordination
- **Memory Management**: LibSQL-backed persistent conversation storage
- **Context Awareness**: Agent builds on previous interactions naturally
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and informative error messages

### **Database & SQL Capabilities**
- **Complex Query Generation**: Aggregations, geographic analysis, statistical operations
- **Safety First**: SELECT-only validation prevents SQL injection
- **Rich Dataset**: 1,047 world cities with population, coordinates, and regional data
- **Performance Considerations**: Appropriate LIMIT usage and query optimization

### **Production Readiness**
- **External API Simulation**: Demonstrates integration patterns for real-world APIs
- **Educational Transparency**: Users can understand what the AI is doing and why
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities
- **Modern TypeScript**: Full type safety with Zod validation

## 💡 Design Philosophy

I focused on building something that:
1. **Exceeds Requirements** - Goes far beyond basic text-to-SQL
2. **Demonstrates Technical Depth** - Shows understanding of production AI systems
3. **Prioritizes User Experience** - Educational, transparent, and helpful
4. **Shows Engineering Judgment** - Clean, maintainable, well-documented code

## 🎯 Interview Discussion Points

I'm excited to discuss:
- **Architecture decisions** and trade-offs made
- **Scaling considerations** for production deployment
- **AI safety and reliability** in agent systems
- **User experience design** for AI-powered tools
- **Future enhancements** and product vision

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **AI Framework**: Mastra v0.15.2 with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
