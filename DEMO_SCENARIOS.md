# üöÄ Text-to-SQL Agent Demo Scenarios

## Overview
This enhanced text-to-SQL agent demonstrates advanced capabilities including memory, analytics, and intelligent insights for exploring world cities data.

## üéØ Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Memory & Context Awareness**
- Remembers previous queries and builds on conversation history
- References past interactions naturally
- Maintains context across multiple related queries

### 2. **Advanced SQL Analytics**
- Basic queries (filtering, sorting, limiting)
- Aggregations (COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX)
- Geographic analysis using coordinates
- Complex multi-table style analysis

### 3. **Smart Insights & Suggestions**
- Automatic data insights generation
- Context-aware query suggestions
- Educational tips about the dataset

## üé™ Demo Flow Suggestions

### **Scenario 1: Basic Exploration**
1. "Show me the 5 most populous cities"
2. "What about the least populous ones?"
3. "Which of these cities are in Asia?"

### **Scenario 2: Geographic Analysis**
1. "Find cities in the Southern Hemisphere"
2. "What's the northernmost city in our database?"
3. "Show me European cities with population over 2 million"

### **Scenario 3: Statistical Analysis**
1. "What's the average population by continent?"
2. "Which continent has the most cities?"
3. "Compare the population ranges between Europe and Asia"

### **Scenario 4: Advanced Queries**
1. "Which countries have the most cities in our database?"
2. "Find cities with similar popularity scores to Paris"
3. "Show me the population distribution across different regions"

### **Scenario 5: Memory Demonstration**
1. Ask about European cities
2. Then ask "What was the average population of those cities?"
3. Follow up with "Show me Asian cities with similar populations"
